## What is this?
While the analysis opens with that discuss I'll give an overview here for those who don't want to dive in.

## Who is Alex G
 Alex G is a somewhat prominent indie musician out of Philly.  He has been writing music for 10+ years and, in the time I'm writing this is 2017. I'm not going to give his entire history, but when people think of "succesful bedroom artists" a moniker he doesn't like, he is one of the artists people think of. Up until the release of Beach Music all of his albums were recorded and mixed by him, of the instruments I'm aware he played in recordings, Alex can play the guitar, bass, drums, banjo, mandolin, keyboard/piano, xylophone, and something else I'm probably missing. His songwriting, lyrics, and production are clever as well, to paraphrase him in an interview "I want my music to hit the 7th time you've listened to it". In my opinion he is one of the greatest and most prolific musicians working today with (including unreleased smusic a 200+ song discography. I understand that he's not everyone's cup of tea, but man is he mine.
